    <div><h1 class="second-header">Purpose</h1></div>
    <div><p>The purpose of the respiratory system is to provide the body with oxygen, while at the same time expelling any waste the body creates in the form of carbon dioxide. The main components of the respiratory system are the diaphragm, lungs, and airways.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="lungs-header">The Lungs</h2>
    <p>The lungs are where all the action takes place in the respiratory system. They are responisble for passing on oxygen to the red blood cells in the blood stream, and removing waste in the form of carbon dioxide. They take in oxygen which travels down the routes and canals in the walls of the lungs. These canals are tubes called "bronchioles", which are paths that lead off from the main bronchiole tubes. At the ends of the bronchioles are the alveoli, which are grape-like sacks that contain capillaries. These capillaries carry blood up to thin parts of the lung, allowing oxygen to pass through and get picked up by the red blood cells. The red blood cells carry a waste product too, in the form of carbon dioxide. The red blood cells drop off the carbon dioxide in the lungs, which expel the gas out of the body.</p>

    <div><h2 class="diaphragm-header">The Diaphragm</h2>
    <p>The diaphragm is what allows the lungs to take in and push out air. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle underneath the lungs that contracts and expands. When the diaphram contracts, it creates negative space in the chest cavity that needs to be filled. That space is filled by air, and the lungs expand to fill in the chest cavity. Then, when the diaphragm expands, it fills up the chest cavity, forcing air out of the lungs. This is how the lungs are able to suck in oxygen and push out carbon dioxide.</p>

    <div><h2 class="airways-header">The Airways</h2>
    <p>The airways in our body are the channels that the air passes through to get to the lungs. This includes the oral cavity, nasal cavity, trachea, pharynx, and bronchiole tubes. The oral and nasal cavities, our nose and mouth, are the first place the air is brought into. From there it passes through the pharynx and into the trachea. From the trachea, the air passes into the bronchiole tubes and through the lungs. Without these airways there would be no way for oxygen to reach the lungs, and it is important for these airways to remain unblocked.</p>
